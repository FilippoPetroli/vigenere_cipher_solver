# Vigenère cipher solver without key
A Vigenère cipher solver project that employs advanced statistical analysis techniques to automatically break the cipher without knowledge of the key. The algorithm iteratively computes the most likely key length and key letters based on the frequency distribution of letters and digrams in the ciphertext, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.

## How to run
To run just type the command below:
```
python viginere_cypher.py
```

## Inputs
There are two inputs, a `.txt` file and the maximum length of key to be tested.
These inputs are on the first lines of the code and you can change them.


## Note
- The solver is designed to work with large English texts.
- Regarding the examples in the `/texts` folder: the first one is in English and the others are in Portuguese.
